OpenTransit is dedicated to empowering people around the world to work with local governments to improve public transit using data, starting with the San Francisco Bay Area. Weâ€™re doing this by visualizing real-time data of the MUNI system so riders understand bus speed and reliability, and using the data to improve the Muni system.
