Launched in October 2016, the Adopt a Drain Program enables San Francisco residents to "adopt" one of the City's 25,000 storm drains, keeping it free of debris. While helping to reduce localized flooding, the program also fosters community engagement by encouraging San Franciscans to take an active role in improving their neighborhood.
