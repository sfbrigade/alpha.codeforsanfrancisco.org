  We are creating a hub for bike data in San Francisco through consolidating
  sources and providing easy access through a single API. Our goal is to
  daylight difficult to find data, which are made available to non-technical
  users through a web service with simple tools and intuitive visualizations.

The immediate goal of Lane Breach is to make it safer for commuters to bike, scoot, or roll around San Francisco. 

While the city is counted among the best for bike infrastructure in the country, the decisons surrounding this infrastructure often rely on incomplete or siloed information. With the recent addition of user-reported bike lane blockages to SF311, we hope to provide city planners and activists some insight on how effective this infrastructure really is.

You can find a short presentation about the high-level motivation for the project [here](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1J0R3I_wG2amPs8QbAZEk9Rl5thQOOkXe8lSRHljDHa4).

We are currently prototyping a collection of services:

\- Backend: rails, postgresql, heroku, docker, graphql

\- Twitter bot: node, AWS Lambda

\- Website: react, Mapbox

\- iOS app that improves 311 mobile experience for bike lane users

\- Android app: help wanted!
